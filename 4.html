        <p><strong>Java</strong></p>
        <p>Java is a high-level programming language developed by Sun Microsystems. 
            It was originally designed for developing programs for set-top boxes and handheld devices, 
            but later became a popular choice for creating web applications. 
            The Java syntax is similar to C++, but is strictly an object-oriented programming language.</p>

        <p><strong>Python</strong></p>
        <p>In technical terms, Python is an object-oriented, high-level programming
             language with integrated dynamic semantics primarily for web and app development.
              It is extremely attractive in the field of Rapid Application Development because 
              it offers dynamic typing and dynamic binding options. </p>
        <p>Python is relatively simple, so itâ€™s easy to learn since it requires a unique 
            syntax that focuses on readability. Developers can read and translate Python 
            code much easier than other languages. In turn, this reduces the cost of program 
            maintenance and development because it allows teams to work collaboratively 
            without significant language and experience barriers.</p>>

        <p><strong>Matlab</strong></p>
        <p>MATLAB (matrix laboratory) is a fourth-generation high-level programming language and interactive 
            environment for numerical computation, visualization and programming. It allows matrix manipulations; 
            plotting of functions and data; implementation of algorithms; creation of user interfaces; interfacing with 
            programs written in other languages, including C, C++, Java, and FORTRAN; analyze data; develop algorithms; 
            and create models and applications. It has numerous built-in commands and math functions that help you in mathematical calculations, generating plots, and performing numerical methods.</p>

        <p><strong>Xilinx</strong></p>
        <p>Xilinx is an American technology company that develops highly flexible 
            and adaptive processing platforms. The company invented the field-programmable gate array (FPGA), 
            programmable system-on-chips (SoCs), and the adaptive compute acceleration platform (ACAP).</p>
